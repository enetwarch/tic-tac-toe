# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple tic tac toe game made with vanilla JavaScript. The rules of the game are well-known and self-explanatory. Basically two players try to have 3 of their marks line up either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This game does not have many possible positions. If both players play perfectly, it will always end in a draw.

> [!NOTE]
> Self note: raw JavaScript so far is very error prone. I had to write a ton of code just for type checking and error handling. I will start using TypeScript on my future projects as it seems to negate said downsides of plain JavaScript.
